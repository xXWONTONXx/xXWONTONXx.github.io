      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>This website was made at Develop Academy led by William Shan, Adhiv Dehar, and Matthew Sotoudeh. This was made entirely out of html and css out of scrach. The creater of this website is Alex Wan, Class of 2021 (High School). The camp took less than 5 days of coding with 3 hours a day to reach this website. I thank my teachers/instructers for this great camp and wish them good luck in Their Senior year of High School and beyond (Go class of 2017!). Thank you for all your hard work making this camp fun under all that stress. I thank you again for your amazing work that you have put into this camp!</p>
