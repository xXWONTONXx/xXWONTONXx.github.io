        <p>Sword Art Online is about a boy, Kazuto, that gets stuck in another world. The other world is a game that they have to beat all 100 levels of a castleto win. He gets stuck in the world because the creaters of the game made it so that there is no log out button. The game makes your realperon in the real world unconcious. If they die in the game, the are dead in the real world. He was a beta tester, so he knows the game. He was one of the fighters of the first level. and he met a girl named Asuna. The leader of the party dies because there was a weapon the boss used in the game that was not in the beta test (the leader was in the beata test and he was aming for a special final boss kill item). Kirito (Kazuto's name in the game) knew about the boss's sword because he had gotten on a defferent level in the beta test and the boss in that level had that wepon. Kirito and Asuna defeted the boss and Kirito got the final kill item. He was called a beater (beater tester + cheater). 2 years pass by and they are almost there. The leader of the party is the createrof the game, and Kirito finds that out and challenges him. Asuna almost dies, Kirito gets angry, Kirito kills the last noss, and they win the game.</p>
